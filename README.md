Research AI Agent â€“ IBM Cloud Implementation
ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Research AI Agent is an AI-powered assistant designed to simplify and accelerate academic and industrial research workflows.
Deployed on IBM Cloud using watsonx.ai and the IBM Granite model, it supports semantic search, paper summarization, citation management, and research gap identification through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

By automating repetitive tasks like literature review and reference management, it enables researchers to focus on innovation, experimentation, and impactful discoveries.
